;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file defines functions to interactively add / delete 'Insert
;; Pair Edit' PAIR Definitions.
;;
;; These functions are used to modify the PAIR Definitions within the
;; `ipe-pairs' / `ipe-mode-pairs' variables.
;;
;; The `ipe-pairs' / `ipe-mode-pairs' variables are used by the
;; `ipe-insert-pair-edit' command to look-up PAIRs.
;;
;; The functions within this file offer an alternative to the
;; `custom'-izations available under the `ipe' group.  (See:
;; `ipe-custom.el')
