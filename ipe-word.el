;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file defines the 'move-by' functionality used by the 'Insert
;; Pair Edit' package for word movement.
;;
;; The 'move-by' functionality is supplied by a set of 'pluggable'
;; functions of the form:
;;
;;   (MOVE-BY-FUNCTION DEFN N SIDE ACTION POS OTHER UNITS PUSH)
;;
;; Where:
;;
;;   DEFN is the definition of the PAIR from `ipe-pairs'.
;;   N is the position of the PAIR in `ipe--pair-pos-list'.
;;   SIDE is either 'open or 'close.
;;   ACTION is either 'init, 'beg, 'up, 'backward, 'forward, 'down,
;;   'end or 'reset.
;;   POS is the position from which the movement begins.
;;   OTHER is the position of the other member of the PAIR.
;;   UNITS are the number of units to move.
;;   PUSH indicates that this is a push move from the other PAIR.
;;
;; And which returns the position to which to set one of strings of a
;; PAIR when the given movement command ('beg, 'up, 'down, 'backward,
;; 'forward, 'end) is entered by the user.
;;
;; This module supplies a function `ipe-word--move-by' which performs
;; this movement for 'words'.

  "Calculate movement `by word' for Insert Pair Edit.

- DEFN is the definition of the PAIR from `ipe-pairs'.
- N is the position of the PAIR in `ipe--pair-pos-list'.
- SIDE is either `'open' or `'close'.
- ACTION is either `'init', `'beg', `'up', `'backward', `'forward',
  `'down', `'end', or `'reset'.
- POS is the position from which the movement begins.
- OTHER is the position of the other member of the PAIR.
- UNITS are the number of units to move.
- PUSH indicates that this is a push move from the other PAIR.

Movement is calculated from POINT."
