;; Widgets and `helper functions' for the customization of the
;; `ipe' package.
;;
;; Most of the helper functions within this package are used to
;; convert between the representations of the 'Insert Pair Edit'
;; variables used to 'nicely' format the `customize' widgets, and, the
;; internal format required by the `ipe-pairs' / `ipe-mode-pairs'
;; variables.  They are expected to be passed as :get and :set options
;; to `defcustom' when defining new variables via 'customize' widgets
;; defined below:
;;
;;   `ipe-custom-pair'
;;   `ipe-custom-pair-list'
;;   `ipe-custom-mode-pairs'

  "Widget to read definitions for Mode-Specific `ipe' PAIRs.

The `ipe-insert-pair-edit' function uses this widget (via `customize')
to display and configure a list of Mode-Specific PAIR definitions.

Each entry in the list of Mode-Specific PAIR definitions is itself a
list consisting of entries of the form:

  (MAJOR-MODE PAIR-DEFINITION-LIST)

Where:

- MAJOR-MODE: is a symbol defining the major mode for which the
  PAIR-DEFINITION-LIST will be defined.
- PAIR-DEFINITION-LIST: is either: a symbol referring to a variable
  which defines a list of PAIR definitions (as per `ipe-pair'), or, an
  inline definition (as per the format of `ipe-pairs') of a list of
  PAIR definitions for the given MAJOR-MODE.
