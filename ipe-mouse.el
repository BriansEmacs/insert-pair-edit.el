;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file adds mouse support for the `ipe' (Insert Pair
;; Edit) package.
;;
;; Bindings for various mouse actions are added to the
;; `ipe-edit-mode-map' keymap.
;;
;;  [mouse-1]        - Move the `ipe' OPEN string to mouse click POS.
;;  [mouse-2]        - Move the `ipe' CLOSE string to mouse click POS.
;;  [mouse-3]        - Display the 'Insert Pair Edit' Context Menu.
;;  [drag-mouse-1]   - Move both the `ipe' OPEN and CLOSE strings.
;;  [double-mouse-1] - Surround the current lexical unit with a PAIR.
;;
;;  [C-mouse-1]      - Add an `ipe' PAIR around mouse click POS.
;;  [C-mouse-2]      - Remove `ipe' PAIR closest to mouse click POS.
;;  [C-drag-mouse-1] - Add an `ipe' PAIR around a region.
;;
;;  [wheel-up]       - Move the `ipe' OPEN string backwards.
;;  [wheel-down]     - Move the `ipe' CLOSE string forwards.
;;  [C-wheel-up]     - Move the `ipe' OPEN string forwards.
;;  [C-wheel-down]   - Move the `ipe' CLOSE string backwards.
;;  [S-wheel-up]     - Move the `ipe' OPEN string backwards (alt)
;;  [S-wheel-down]   - Move the `ipe' CLOSE string forwards (alt)
;;  [C-S-wheel-up]   - Move the `ipe' OPEN string forwards (alt)
;;  [C-S-wheel-down] - Move the `ipe' CLOSE string backwards (alt)
;;  [M-wheel-up]     - Change to the 'next' move-by function.
;;  [M-wheel-down]   - Change to the 'previous' move-by function.
