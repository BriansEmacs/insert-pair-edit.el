;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file defines a function, `ipe-read--mnemonic', used to
;; prompt the user for an 'Insert Pair Edit' MNEMONIC using the Emacs
;; minibuffer.
;;
;; This function uses `completing-read' to offer completions for the
;; `ipe' MNEMONICs from the `ipe-pairs' / `ipe-mode-pairs' variables.
;;
;; When the `ipe-mnemonic-prompt-shortcut-p' variable is set to `t',
;; special shortcut behaviour is added to `completing-read', whereby
;; entering a complete unique MNEMONIC (for the current major-mode)
;; into the minibuffer will immediately exit the minibuffer without
;; requiring the user to enter a <RET>.
